<p>The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led many countries and regions to enact various interventions, such as social
distancing, school closures, and border control, in order to mitigate the growth of infection rates. Understanding the effects
of these policies is particularly important since every intervention strategy comes with its side effects.
We wanted to understand the impact of strategies and their combinations on the disease spread.
After collecting data at the country and state levels for various types of interventions, we overlaid
them on the disease growth curves, shown below.</p>

<p>(<b>Disclaimer</b>: There is danger in
extrapolating too much from limited historical data, especially since many of the case numbers are subjected to
other confounds, such as the amount and availability of tests. We will be keeping the dashboard up-to-date with
the latest data to see how these trends unfold.)</p>

<h2 id="lockdown_section">Effect of lockdown</h2>
<p>
    First, we plot the log of the number confirmed cases across the top ten countries with the highest number of cases. We
    overlaid SARS-CoV-2 trends with various countermeasures taken by governing entities. We invite the reader to reveal
    such measures in the chart by clicking the legend, the dropdown below the chart, or the chart itself.
</p>

<p>
    A lockdown can be a full lockdown in that there is a nation-wide declaration of a lockdown.
    On the other hand, a partial lockdown means that some but not all
    regions within the country that have declared a lockdown, such as in case of the United States. We also plot a
    projection line for the original trajectory of the trend before the lockdown date. The projection extrapolates the
    growth curve based on the slope computed up until the lockdown date. This projection is based on the simple
    assumption that the growth rate stays fixed throughout the entire period of time, which is not always a valid
    assumption for a number of reasons. For example, as the number of infected individuals increases, the
    <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">
    growth will likely slow
    </a>
    due to the growing number of recovered people with immunity. Nevertheless, this serves as one comparison point that
    we can use to understand the effects of these interventions in slowing the infection rates.

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>Why build yet another COVID-19 visualization?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>While there are many COVID-19 visualization dashboards, including those that employ helpful log-linear extrapolation to understand the trends in various regions, we haven‚Äôt found any dashboards that try to visualize the overlaid visual impact of various intervention measures, apart from anecdotal reports of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html">curve being flattened</a> thanks to interventions. If there are any visualization dashboards that we should be aware of and can link to, please share them with us at <a href="mailto:covidvis@berkeley.edu">covidvis@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>What‚Äôs next for the project?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The dashboards above simply scratch the surface of what can be and what needs to be done for this project. Apart from keeping our dashboards up-to-date on a regular basis, we‚Äôre in the process of collecting, studying, and visualizing the impact of fine-grained interventions (specifically, the impact of various combinations of interventions, such as school closures, banning of gatherings, non-essential business closures, and so on). Beyond Wikipedia, we are aware of other data-gathering efforts on this front, such as those from <a href="https://www.keystonestrategy.com/coronavirus-covid19-intervention-dataset-model/">Keystone</a> and <a href="https://socialdistancing.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>. We hope to leverage these datasets as well as others we manually collect to perform these analyses.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>How can we reproduce the charts above?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Our Jupyter notebooks and processing scripts are online on <a href="https://github.com/covidvis/covid19-vis">GitHub</a>. We also plan to make our intervention data available soon.</p>
